# How to work with the website

1.  **Clone the repository.**

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:bilbostack/website.git
```
    
2.  **Start developing.**

Navigate into your directory and start it up.


``` 
cd website/  

yarn install  

gatsby develop  
```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

> note: you need to restart the server if you make changes in the data/data.js files

You can work with the data/data.js file and adding markdown pages in the data/content directory.
